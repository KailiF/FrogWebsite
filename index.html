        <h1> Cool Stuff About Frogs </h1>
        <h2> Frogs are Fascinating Amphibians </h2>
        <p>
            Frogs are amphibians, which means they live part of their lives in water and part on land. They are found all over the world except in Antarctica, thriving in a variety of habitats such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands. Frogs play an essential role in the ecosystem as both predators and prey. They consume insects and other small creatures, helping control pest populations, and serve as food for birds, snakes, and other larger animals.
        </p>
        <h2> Anatomy and Adaptations </h2>
        <p>
            Frogs have several physical adaptations that make them unique. Their long, powerful legs are ideal for jumping great distances, while their sticky toes help them climb and grip surfaces. Many species have smooth, moist skin that aids in respiration and camouflage, blending into their surroundings to evade predators. Additionally, some frogs exhibit bright, vibrant colors, a warning to potential threats that they may be poisonous.
        </p>
        <h2> Lifecycle and Metamorphosis </h2>
        <p>
            The life cycle of a frog is a classic example of metamorphosis. Frogs lay eggs in water, which hatch into tadpoles. These tadpoles are aquatic and breathe through gills. Over time, they develop legs, lose their tails, and transform into adult frogs capable of living on land. This process highlights the adaptability of frogs and their ability to thrive in diverse environments.
        </p>
        <h2> Diverse Species and Behaviors </h2>
        <p>
            There are over 7,000 known species of frogs, each with unique traits and behaviors. The Goliath frog of West Africa is the largest, growing up to 13 inches long and weighing over seven pounds, while the Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New Guinea is the smallest, measuring less than half an inch. Frogs have fascinating calls used for communication, particularly during mating season, where males sing to attract females.
